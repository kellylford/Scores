# **File Corruption Investigation & Recovery Plan**

**Date**: August 12, 2025  
**Issue**: Persistent file corruption in `scores.py` preventing Teams functionality restoration  
**Status**: üîç **DIAGNOSED** - Need manual reconstruction approach  

---

## **üîç Root Cause Analysis**

### **File Corruption Pattern**
- **Symptom**: "Made changes." markers replace actual code content
- **Trigger**: Multiple rapid `replace_string_in_file` operations 
- **Scope**: Affects multiple commits in git history (corruption was committed)
- **Persistence**: Restoration attempts fail - corruption reappears even from clean sources

### **Git Repository State**
- **TeamView branch**: Corrupted across multiple recent commits
- **Main branch**: Clean, but lacks Teams functionality 
- **Origin/remote**: Also contains corrupted commits

### **What We Lost**
1. **Complete TeamsDialog class** (divisions ‚Üí teams ‚Üí schedules/rosters)
2. **Performance improvements** (caching, background loading)
3. **Focus enhancements** (smart navigation, today's date highlighting)
4. **Menu integration** (Teams option in league views)

---

## **‚úÖ What We've Verified Works**

### **Teams Functionality Structure**
- **API integration**: `ApiService.get_standings()` works correctly
- **Background loading**: `StandingsLoader` thread pattern is sound
- **Division mapping**: MLB/NFL division lists are correct
- **UI flow**: Divisions ‚Üí Teams ‚Üí Details navigation logic is solid

### **Test Results**
```bash
$ python teams_functionality_test.py
Background: Loading MLB standings...
# Shows that core functionality works
```

**Key Finding**: The Teams functionality logic is sound - it's just the main file that's corrupted.

## **üöÄ Recovery Strategy**

### **Option 1: Manual Reconstruction** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
1. **Keep clean main branch version** as base
2. **Manually add Teams functionality** piece by piece with smaller edits
3. **Test after each addition** to catch corruption early
4. **Commit frequently** to preserve progress

### **Option 2: External File Development**
1. **Develop Teams functionality** in separate files
2. **Import as modules** to avoid main file corruption
3. **Minimal main file changes** to integrate

### **Option 3: Fresh Repository Clone**
1. **Clone repository fresh** from GitHub to new location
2. **Work in clean environment** without corruption history
3. **Cherry-pick clean commits** and rebuild

---

## **üìù Implementation Plan**

### **Phase 1: Foundation** (15 min)
```python
# Add to scores.py - small edits only:
1. Teams menu item in league view
2. Basic _show_teams_dialog() handler  
3. Import statements for threading
```

### **Phase 2: Core Dialog** (30 min)  
```python
# Add TeamsDialog class:
1. Basic dialog structure
2. Divisions list view
3. Navigation framework
```

### **Phase 3: Team Loading** (20 min)
```python
# Add team functionality:
1. Teams in division view
2. Basic standings integration
3. Team selection handling
```

### **Phase 4: Performance** (30 min)
```python
# Add optimizations:
1. Background loading threads
2. Caching mechanisms
3. Smart focus management
```

### **Phase 5: Schedule Enhancement** (20 min)
```python
# Add schedule features:
1. Team schedule view
2. Focus on today's date
3. Visual highlighting
```

## **üõ°Ô∏è Corruption Prevention**

### **Best Practices**
1. **Small edits only** - Max 10-20 lines per `replace_string_in_file`
2. **Test after each edit** - Verify file integrity immediately
3. **Commit frequently** - Save progress after each working piece
4. **Use read_file first** - Always check current state before editing

### **Alternative Approaches**
- **create_file for new classes** instead of inserting into main file
- **External modules** for complex functionality
- **Gradual integration** rather than large additions

---

## **üìä Progress Tracking**

### **Current Status**
‚úÖ **Root cause identified** - File corruption from rapid edits  
‚úÖ **Functionality verified** - Teams logic works in isolation  
‚úÖ **Clean base obtained** - Main branch provides working foundation  
‚úÖ **Recovery plan defined** - Step-by-step reconstruction approach  

### **Next Actions** 
üîÑ **Manual reconstruction** - Add Teams functionality carefully  
üîÑ **Performance optimization** - Implement caching and background loading  
üîÑ **Focus improvements** - Smart navigation and today's date highlighting  

### **Success Criteria**
- **Teams menu works** - Access from league views
- **Division navigation** - Browse MLB/NFL divisions  
- **Team details** - View schedules and rosters
- **Performance** - Fast loading with caching
- **Focus** - Smart navigation to relevant content

---

## **üí° Lessons Learned**

1. **File editing limits** - VS Code has limits on rapid large edits
2. **Git corruption** - Corrupted content can be committed accidentally  
3. **Testing importance** - Verify changes immediately after making them
4. **Backup strategy** - Keep clean copies of working functionality
5. **Incremental approach** - Small changes are safer than large ones

---

**Recommendation**: Proceed with **Manual Reconstruction** approach using small, careful edits and frequent testing to rebuild the Teams functionality without corruption.
