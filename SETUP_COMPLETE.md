# Scores Application - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Virtual Environment
- ✅ Created `.venv` directory
- ✅ Activated and configured Python 3.13.6
- ✅ Isolated dependencies from system Python

### 2. Dependencies Installed
- ✅ **PyQt6 6.9.1** - GUI framework
- ✅ **requests 2.32.4** - API calls
- ✅ **PyInstaller 6.15.0** - Executable builder
- ✅ All supporting packages

### 3. Requirements Files
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - Complete dependency list (15 packages)
- ✅ `requirements-minimal.txt` - Essential dependencies only (3 packages)

### 4. Entry Points Fixed
- ✅ `scores.py` - Main application (primary entry point)
- ✅ `main.py` - Fixed import issue, now works as alternative entry point

### 5. Windows Executable Built
- ✅ `dist/Scores.exe` - Standalone executable (~40MB)
- ✅ Includes all dependencies (PyQt6, Python runtime, etc.)
- ✅ Can be distributed to other Windows machines
- ✅ No Python installation required on target machines

### 6. Build Scripts
- ✅ `build-enhanced.bat` - Automated build script with error handling
- ✅ `build.bat` - Original build script (preserved)
- ✅ Both scripts create clean, distributable executable

### 7. Documentation
- ✅ `BUILD_GUIDE.md` - Comprehensive setup and build instructions
- ✅ `SETUP_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

## 🚀 How to Use

### Running from Source
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/Scripts/activate

# Run the application
python scores.py
# or
python main.py
```

### Running the Executable
```bash
# Simply double-click or run:
dist/Scores.exe
```

### Rebuilding the Executable
```bash
# Option 1: Enhanced script (recommended)
build-enhanced.bat

# Option 2: Manual build
source .venv/Scripts/activate
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name=Scores scores.py
```

## ✨ Key Features Confirmed
- **Entry Points**: Both `scores.py` and `main.py` work correctly
- **Dependencies**: All core requirements (PyQt6, requests) installed
- **Executable**: Standalone Windows executable built successfully
- **Virtual Environment**: Isolated Python environment for clean deployment
- **Build Process**: Automated scripts for easy rebuilding

## 📝 Next Steps
1. Test the executable on your local machine: `dist/Scores.exe`
2. Distribute the executable to other Windows machines if needed
3. Use the virtual environment for development: `source .venv/Scripts/activate`
4. Rebuild when code changes: `build-enhanced.bat`

## 🔧 Maintenance
- **Update dependencies**: `pip install --upgrade PyQt6 requests pyinstaller`
- **Rebuild after changes**: Run `build-enhanced.bat`
- **Clean build**: Delete `dist/` and `build/` folders before rebuilding
