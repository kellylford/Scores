Objective: To provide a single view, much like the scores level for each sport, of all games going on live

Design:

Entry Point: Live scores should be another entry off the opening screen of the scores app positioned as the first entry above all sports. When activated the user goes to a list just like other individual sports but it shows the game entries for anything ESPN reports as happening now.

Activating any game takes you to the details for that game.

If it is available, after the current score we show, the most recent play should be summarized. For example ball 3 to <batter name>

Accessibility:
Web has a concept known as ARIA-Live which allows updates to be communicated to assistive technology no matter if that item has focus or not. Windows has their standard notification infrastructure along with assistive technology-specific notifications known as UIA notifications. We should try and leverage this technology to provide live updating of scores.

When focus is on the game in this view, pressing m will toggle monitoring of the game. Monitoring on means the user will get notifications about changes.

Notes:
Actively explore ESPN APIs for what's possible here. We may need to try during different time periods. As of this writing a baseball game between the Cubs and Pirates is active.
