## Technical Implementation

### Detection Logic
The Kitchen Sink only appears when the game has additional data available:
- Checks for presence of: `rosters`, `seasonseries`, `article`, `againstTheSpread`, `pickcenter`, `winprobability`, `videos`
- Only shows tabs for fields that actually contain data
- Automatically adapts to available content

### User Interface
- **Accessible Design**: All tables use the AccessibleTable class for screen reader support
- **Keyboard Navigation**: F6 key cycles between tabs
- **Responsive Layout**: Scrollable content areas for large datasets
- **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing application design patterns

### Data Handling
- Robust error handling for missing or malformed data
- Graceful degradation when fields are empty
- Flexible data structure parsing (handles lists, dicts, nested objects)

2. **Look for Kitchen Sink**: If additional data is available, you'll see "Kitchen Sink (Additional MLB Data)" in the details list
