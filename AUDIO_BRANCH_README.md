# Audio Feature Branch - README

## 🎵 **Audio Pitch Map Feature Development**

This branch contains experimental development for revolutionary audio accessibility features that transform pitch coordinate data into spatial audio feedback.

## 🌟 **Feature Concept**
Convert our validated pitch location data (85.4% accuracy) into multi-dimensional audio experience:
- **Spatial Audio**: Inside/outside pitches mapped to left/right stereo
- **Frequency Mapping**: High/low pitches mapped to tone frequency  
- **Velocity Audio**: Pitch speed represented through sound timing
- **Pitch Type Signatures**: Different sounds for fastballs, sliders, etc.

## 📁 **Branch Contents**

### **Development Documentation**
- `AUDIO_PITCH_MAP_DEVELOPMENT.md` - Complete feature specifications and implementation plan
- Audio mapping strategies and technical research
- User interface design and accessibility considerations

### **Technical Foundation** 
- All validated pitch location code from main branch
- ESPN API coordinate system (X: 85-145 strike zone, Y: 150-195)
- PyQt6 framework with existing audio capabilities

## 🛡️ **Safety Approach**
This branch ensures we can experiment with audio features without disrupting the stable, functioning game functionality on main branch.

## 🎯 **Development Goals**
1. **Phase 1**: Basic audio location mapping prototype
2. **Phase 2**: Multi-dimensional audio (velocity, pitch type)  
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features (pitch symphony, learning modes)
4. **Phase 4**: 3D spatial audio and haptic feedback

## 🔧 **Current Status**
- **Planning Phase**: Feature specifications complete
- **Research Phase**: Audio library evaluation needed
- **Prototyping**: Ready to begin technical implementation

## 🚀 **Potential Impact**
This could be the **first-ever spatial audio pitch tracking system** for accessibility, potentially becoming an industry standard for accessible sports applications.

**To merge back to main**: Audio features must be thoroughly tested and not interfere with existing functionality  
**Parallel development**: Can work alongside other feature branches like teamview  
**Foundation**: Built on validated pitch location system with 85.4% accuracy
