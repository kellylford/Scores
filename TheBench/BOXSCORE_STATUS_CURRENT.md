# Boxscore Feature Development Status Report
**Date: August 8, 2025**  
**Issue: Boxscore keyboard navigation and data display**

## üéØ PROBLEM SUMMARY
**Original Issues:**
1. "box score isn't getting data properly, sometimes showing html to end user"
2. "couldn't get keyboared into box score data" - keyboard navigation not working

## ‚úÖ MAJOR SUCCESS: KEYBOARD NAVIGATION FIXED
- **BoxscoreTable widgets are being created**: "Found 2 BoxscoreTable widgets" ‚úÖ
- **Keyboard navigation is fully functional**: Can Tab into tables, navigate cells with arrows ‚úÖ
- **Focus management works**: "Focus and cell selection set successfully" ‚úÖ
- **Screen reader accessible**: Debug dialog with copy button works ‚úÖ

## üîç CURRENT ISSUE: DATA FLOW DISCONNECT

### ESPN API Layer (WORKING PERFECTLY):
The `_parse_boxscore_data()` function in `espn_api.py` successfully extracts:
```
DEBUG: Team name resolved to: 'Chicago White Sox'
DEBUG: Team name resolved to: 'Seattle Mariners'
DEBUG: Added stat hits: 7
DEBUG: Added stat runs: 3
DEBUG: Added stat avg: .175
DEBUG: Added stat ERA: 1.74
DEBUG: Added stat strikeouts: 12
[170+ statistics successfully parsed for each team including batting, pitching, fielding]
```

### UI Layer (RECEIVING WRONG DATA):
The `_add_boxscore_data_to_layout()` function in `main.py` receives:
```
DEBUG UI: Team name: 'Unknown Team'
DEBUG UI: stats count: 0
Table displays: "No statistics available: N/A"
```

## üéØ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Data Pipeline Issue**: Rich parsed data (team names, 170+ stats) gets lost between:
- `_parse_boxscore_data()` return (working perfectly)
- `_add_boxscore_data_to_layout()` input (receiving empty/wrong data)

## üìã DEBUGGING EVIDENCE

### Test Case: Seattle Mariners vs Chicago White Sox (Thursday game)
**ESPN API Parsing Output:**
- Teams found: 2
- Chicago White Sox: 170+ stats (batting: hits=7, runs=3, avg=.175; pitching: ERA=1.74, strikeouts=12; fielding: errors=2)
- Seattle Mariners: 170+ stats (batting: hits=6, runs=4, avg=.162; pitching: ERA=1.64, wins=1; fielding: errors=1)
- Player groups: 2 (12 and 13 athletes per team in batting/pitching groups)

**UI Display Result:**
- Team names: "Unknown Team" (both teams)
- Team stats: Empty dictionaries
- Tables created but show placeholder data

## üõ† KEY TECHNICAL FIXES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. BoxscoreTable Creation (SOLVED)
**Problem**: Tables weren't being created due to empty team stats condition
**Solution**: Removed `if team_stats:` requirement, tables created unconditionally
```python
# OLD: if team_stats: (prevented table creation)
# NEW: Always create tables, show placeholder if no data
```

### 2. Enhanced Data Parsing (WORKING)
**Enhanced**: `_parse_boxscore_data()` function with:
- Multiple team name resolution attempts (displayName, name, abbreviation)
- Comprehensive stat extraction (all categories, not just filtered)
- Detailed debug output showing successful parsing

### 3. Improved Focus Management (WORKING)
**Enhanced**: BoxscoreTable focus handling with:
- Guaranteed focus setting on first table
- Proper cell selection (0,0)
- Tab navigation between dialog elements

### 4. Accessible Debug System (WORKING)
**Added**: Screen reader accessible debug dialog with:
- QListWidget instead of terminal output
- Copy to clipboard functionality
- Detailed widget count and focus status

## üìÅ FILES MODIFIED

### `espn_api.py`
- Enhanced `_parse_boxscore_data()` with robust team name extraction
- Comprehensive stat parsing (batting, pitching, fielding, records)
- Extensive debug output showing successful data extraction
- Player data processing for all athlete groups

### `main.py`
- Modified `_add_boxscore_data_to_layout()` to guarantee table creation
- Added comprehensive debug output for data flow tracking
- Enhanced focus management with QTimer-based delays
- Accessible debug dialog with copy functionality
- Fixed copy button timer crash issue

### `accessible_table.py`
- BoxscoreTable class with proper keyboard navigation
- Enhanced focus policies and event handling
- Screen reader accessibility features
- Tab/arrow key navigation working correctly

## üîß NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

### 1. CRITICAL: Trace Data Flow Pipeline
**Investigate**: What happens between successful parsing and broken UI display
- Add debug in `extract_meaningful_game_info()` 
- Check if parsed data gets transformed/corrupted
- Verify data structure expected by UI matches parser output

### 2. Fix Data Structure Mismatch
**Expected**: UI function should receive the rich data that parser creates
**Reality**: UI receives empty data with "Unknown Team"
**Action**: Find and fix the transformation step losing the data

### 3. Test Player Data Display
**Current**: Player statistics are parsed but not yet displayed in UI
**Goal**: Show batting/pitching player stats in second tab

## üéØ SUCCESS CRITERIA

### ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] BoxscoreTable widgets creation
- [x] Keyboard navigation (Tab into tables, arrow key cell navigation)
- [x] Focus management and screen reader accessibility
- [x] Comprehensive ESPN API data parsing
- [x] Debug system for troubleshooting

### üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- [ ] Team name display (data parsed correctly, UI display broken)
- [ ] Team statistics display (170+ stats parsed, none reaching UI)
- [ ] Player statistics tabs (data parsed, UI implementation needed)

### üìä TECHNICAL METRICS
- **Keyboard Navigation**: 100% working
- **Data Parsing**: 100% working (170+ stats per team)
- **UI Display**: 0% working (data pipeline issue)
- **Debug Accessibility**: 100% working

## üöÄ RESUMPTION STRATEGY
1. **Start Here**: Add debug output in `extract_meaningful_game_info()` to trace data flow
2. **Key Question**: Where does `{'teams': [{'name': 'Chicago White Sox', 'stats': {...170 stats...}}]}` become `{'teams': [{'name': 'Unknown Team', 'stats': {}}]}`?
3. **Test Case**: Use Thursday Seattle vs Chicago game for consistent reproduction

**Status**: Keyboard navigation SOLVED ‚úÖ | Data display pipeline investigation needed üîç
