# NCAAF Scoring Drive Implementation - Complete

## ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION SUCCESSFUL**

### Summary of Changes Made
Successfully extended the NFL scoring drive enhancement to support **NCAAF (College Football)** with identical functionality and enhanced college-specific drive results.

### **Files Modified**
**`scores.py`** - 5 targeted changes:

   - Updated: `"""Add NFL/NCAAF drives data to layout (Football-specific method)"""`

3. **Enhanced Drive Result Detection**
   - **Added NCAAF-specific results:**
     - `'INT'` → 🔄 TURNOVER (college uses 'INT' vs 'INTERCEPTION')
     - `'DOWNS'` → 🛑 4TH DOWN (turnover on downs - college specific)
     - `'END OF HALF'/'END OF GAME'` → ⏰ CLOCK (clock expiration)

4. **Accessibility Descriptions** (Line ~2023)
   - Dynamic sport naming: `"NFL/NCAAF"` when applicable
