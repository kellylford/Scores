# Live Scores Feature Implementation

## Overview
The Live Scores feature provides real-time monitoring of games across all major sports with enhanced baseball details, optimized performance, and accessible controls.

## Key Features Implemented

### üèüÔ∏è **Live Game Monitoring**
- **Real-time updates**: 30-second automatic refresh cycle
- **Multi-sport support**: MLB, NFL, NBA, NHL, WNBA, NCAAF, NCAAM, Soccer
- **Smart filtering**: Only shows actively live/in-progress games
- **Score change notifications**: Windows UIA notifications for accessibility

### ‚öæ **Enhanced Baseball Information**
Enhanced from basic status to detailed game situation:
- **Before**: "Top 5th | 0 Outs"
- **After**: "P: Zack Wheeler | AB: Robert Hassell III | Count: 0-1 | 1 out"

**Baseball Details Include**:
- Pitcher name (P: [Name])
- Current batter (AB: [Name]) 
- Pitch count (Count: balls-strikes)
- Outs in inning
- Extracted from ESPN API participants and situation data

### üéÆ **User Controls**
- **Alt+M**: Toggle monitoring for selected game (avoids first-letter navigation conflicts)
- **F5**: Manual refresh of live scores
- **Enter/Space**: Open detailed game view
- **Escape**: Return to Live Scores from game details (proper navigation context)

### üìä **Performance Optimization**
**Hybrid API Strategy**:
1. **Fast Discovery**: Use ESPN events endpoints to identify live games (~1.6s)
2. **Selective Details**: Only call detailed APIs for confirmed live games
3. **Result**: 4-5 seconds total vs original implementation that caused freezing

**Before Optimization**:
- Called `get_game_details()` for every game whether live or not
- 30+ API calls taking 10+ seconds, causing UI freezing

**After Optimization**:
- Fast events endpoint to find live games first
- Selective detailed calls only for live games
- 8-12 total API calls taking 4-5 seconds

## Technical Implementation

### üîß **Core Components**

#### LiveScoresView Class (`scores.py`)
```python
class LiveScoresView(BaseView):
    def __init__(self, parent=None):
        # Monitoring state
        self.monitored_games = set()
        self.game_data = {}
        self.notification_helper = WindowsNotificationHelper()
        
        # Auto-refresh timer
        self.refresh_timer = QTimer()
        self.refresh_timer.timeout.connect(self.refresh_live_scores)
```

**Key Methods**:
- `load_live_scores()`: Fetch and display live games
- `_toggle_monitoring()`: Alt+M handler for game monitoring
- `refresh_live_scores()`: Check for score changes in monitored games
- `_on_game_selected()`: Navigate to game details with proper context

#### Enhanced API Layer (`espn_api.py`)

**Optimized Live Scores Function**:
```python
def get_live_scores_all_sports():
    """Hybrid approach: fast discovery + selective details"""
    for league_key in LEAGUES.keys():
        # 1. Fast events endpoint for discovery
        url = f"{BASE_URL}/{league_path}/events"
        
        # 2. Filter for live games only
        if is_live:
            # 3. Get detailed play info for live games only
            game_details = get_game_details(league_key, game_id)
            recent_play = extract_recent_play(game_details)
```

**Enhanced Play Extraction**:
```python
def extract_recent_play(game_details):
    """Extract pitcher, batter, count, and outs for baseball"""
    # 1. Build player ID-to-name mapping from rosters
    # 2. Extract situation data (count, outs)
    # 3. Find pitcher/batter from recent plays participants
    # 4. Parse play text as fallback
    # 5. Format: "P: Name | AB: Name | Count: X-Y | Z outs"
```

### üì° **API Endpoints Used**

#### Fast Discovery
- **Pattern**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/events`
- **Purpose**: Quickly identify live games
- **Speed**: ~0.2s per league
- **Data**: Game status, basic scores, team names

#### Detailed Information
- **Pattern**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/summary?event={game_id}`
- **Purpose**: Rich play-by-play data, player names, situation details
- **Speed**: ~0.4s per game
- **Usage**: Only called for confirmed live games

### üß≠ **Navigation System**

**Context-Aware Navigation**:
```python
def open_game_details(self, game_id: str, from_live_scores=False):
    if from_live_scores:
        self._push_to_stack("live_scores", None)
    else:
        self._push_to_stack("league", self.current_league)
```

**Navigation Stack**:
- Home ‚Üí Live Scores ‚Üí Game Details ‚Üí (Escape) ‚Üí Live Scores
- League View ‚Üí Game Details ‚Üí (Escape) ‚Üí League View
- Proper source tracking prevents navigation confusion

### ‚ôø **Accessibility Features**

#### Windows UIA Notifications
```python
class WindowsNotificationHelper:
    def notify_score_change(self, game_name, score_text):
        # Screen reader announcements for score changes
        
    def notify_monitoring_change(self, game_name, monitoring):
        # Announce monitoring status changes
```

#### UI Accessibility
- **No emoji clutter**: Clean text-only indicators
- **Clear instructions**: "Press 'Alt+M' to toggle monitoring"
- **Monitoring indicators**: "- monitoring" suffix instead of emoji
- **Screen reader descriptions**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions

### üîÑ **Monitoring System**

#### Score Change Detection
```python
def refresh_live_scores(self):
    # 1. Capture current scores for monitored games
    old_scores = {game_id: (team1_score, team2_score) for ...}
    
    # 2. Reload live scores
    self.load_live_scores()
    
    # 3. Compare and notify changes
    for game_id in self.monitored_games:
        if new_scores != old_scores[game_id]:
            self._notify_score_change(game, old_scores, new_scores)
```

#### Automatic Refresh
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Smart updates**: Only refreshes when Live Scores view is active
- **Change detection**: Compares scores before/after refresh
- **Notifications**: UIA announcements for monitored game changes

## Data Structures

### Game Data Format
```python
game = {
    "id": "401696733",
    "name": "Milwaukee Brewers at Cincinnati Reds",
    "league": "MLB",
    "status": "Top 3rd",
    "teams": [
        {"name": "Milwaukee Brewers", "score": "6"},
        {"name": "Cincinnati Reds", "score": "8"}
    ],
    "recent_play": "P: Zack Wheeler | AB: Robert Hassell III | Count: 0-1 | 1 out"
}
```

### Display Format Examples
```
Baseball: "P: Zack Wheeler | AB: Robert Hassell III | Count: 0-1 | 1 out"
Football: "7:32 - 2nd"
Basketball: "Timeout - Lakers"
```
