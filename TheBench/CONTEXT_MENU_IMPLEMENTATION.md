## ðŸ“‹ **Example Usage**

### **Lindor At-Bat Sequence:**
```
Right-click on any Lindor pitch â†’ "ðŸŽµ Play Pitch Sequence"

Audio Sequence:
BEEP! (Strike 1 - fastball, center)
â†’ 1.2s pause â†’
BEEP! (Strike 2 - cutter, center) 
â†’ 1.2s pause â†’
beep (Ball 1 - curve, low outside)
â†’ 1.2s pause â†’  
beep (Ball 2 - cutter, outside)
â†’ 1.2s pause â†’
beep (HBP - sinker, low inside)

"Pitch sequence complete"
```

### **Individual Pitch Analysis:**
```
Right-click on HBP pitch â†’ "ðŸ”Š Play Pitch Audio"
â†’ Low frequency beep (represents low pitch location)
â†’ "Playing audio for pitch at (28, 199) - low and way inside"
```
