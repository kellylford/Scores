# GitHub Project Management Best Practices for Solo Developers

This guide provides actionable best practices for using GitHub to track your projects from end-to-end, including linking issues to releases, versioning, managing all aspects of your project, and tips for solo developers.

## 1. Linking Issues to Releases

- **Reference Issues in Pull Requests:** When you fix an issue, mention it in your pull request description using keywords like `Closes #issue-number` or `Fixes #issue-number`. This automatically closes the issue when the PR is merged.
- **Release Notes:** When creating a release, summarize the issues fixed in the release notes. You can use the GitHub Releases page to draft a release and list all closed issues since the last release.
- **Milestones:** Use milestones to group issues and pull requests for a specific release. Assign issues/PRs to a milestone named after the release version.
- **Labels:** Tag issues with labels like `bug`, `feature`, or the target release version for easier tracking.

## 2. Versioning and Releases

- **Semantic Versioning:** Use [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (e.g., `v1.2.3`) for your tags and releases. Increment:
  - MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
  - MINOR version for new features
  - PATCH version for bug fixes
- **Tags:** Create annotated tags for each release (`git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release v1.2.3"`). Push tags to GitHub (`git push origin v1.2.3`).
- **GitHub Releases:** Use the Releases tab to publish new versions, attach release notes, and link to relevant issues/PRs.
- **Changelog:** Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` documenting changes, fixes, and improvements for each version.

## 3. Managing Ideas, Code, Tests, Documentation, and Releases

- **Ideas:** Track ideas and feature requests as issues. Use labels like `idea`, `enhancement`, or `discussion`.
- **Code:** Use branches for features, fixes, and experiments. Merge changes via pull requests for traceability.
- **Tests:** Store tests in a dedicated directory (e.g., `tests/`). Link test-related issues to PRs and releases.
- **Documentation:** Keep documentation up-to-date in `README.md`, docs folders, or markdown files. Reference documentation updates in issues and PRs.
- **Releases:** Use milestones, tags, and release notes to organize and communicate releases. Close related issues when merging release PRs.

## 4. Tips for Solo Developers

- **Automate Where Possible:** Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD, automated testing, and release workflows.
- **Stay Organized:** Use labels, milestones, and projects to keep track of tasks and priorities.
- **Document Decisions:** Record key decisions and rationale in issues, PRs, or dedicated docs.
- **Regular Backups:** Push changes frequently and use tags/releases for backup points.
- **Review Your Own Work:** Use PRs even for solo work to document changes and enable code review features.
- **Leverage Templates:** Use issue and PR templates to standardize reporting and tracking.

By following these practices, you can efficiently manage your project lifecycle, track progress, and maintain high-quality releasesâ€”even as a solo developer.
