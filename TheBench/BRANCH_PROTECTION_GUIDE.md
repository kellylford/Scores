# GitHub Branch Protection & Release Branch Management Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide covers how to protect and "lock" branches in GitHub, with specific focus on preserving release branches and preventing unwanted changes to completed releases.

## üîí Branch Protection Concepts

### What is Branch Protection?
GitHub's **Branch Protection Rules** allow you to control how changes are made to specific branches. While not technically "locking," these rules can effectively prevent modifications to important branches.

### Common Use Cases
- **Protect main/master branch** - Require pull requests and reviews
- **Lock release branches** - Prevent changes to completed releases  
- **Enforce quality gates** - Require CI/CD checks before merging
- **Maintain history** - Preserve important development milestones

## üõ†Ô∏è Branch Protection Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Web Interface (Recommended)

#### **Step-by-Step Setup:**

1. **Navigate to Repository Settings**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click the **Settings** tab
   - Select **Branches** from the left sidebar

2. **Create Protection Rule**
   - Click **Add rule** or **Add classic branch protection rule**
   - Enter branch name pattern (see patterns below)

3. **Configure Protection Options**
   - Choose from available protection settings
   - Apply to administrators if desired
   - Save the rule

#### **Branch Name Patterns:**
```bash
# Specific branch
main

# All release branches
*release

# Version-specific releases  
v*.*.*

# Multiple patterns (separate rules needed)
release/*
hotfix/*
```

#### **Protection Options:**
- ‚úÖ **Restrict pushes to matching branches** - Prevents direct pushes
- ‚úÖ **Require a pull request before merging** - Forces PR workflow
- ‚úÖ **Require status checks to pass** - CI/CD must succeed
- ‚úÖ **Require branches to be up to date** - Must sync with base branch
- ‚úÖ **Require review from code owners** - Designated reviewers needed
- ‚úÖ **Dismiss stale reviews** - New commits invalidate approvals
- ‚úÖ **Restrict who can push** - Only specific users/teams
- ‚úÖ **Include administrators** - Rules apply to repo owners too

### Method 2: GitHub CLI

#### **Installation:**
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI
# Windows (via winget)
winget install GitHub.cli

# Or download from: https://cli.github.com/
```

#### **Branch Protection Commands:**
```bash
# Lock a specific release branch
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/branches/BRANCH/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":[],"apps":[]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true

# Example for our Scores repository
gh api repos/kellylford/Scores/branches/0.5release/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field restrictions='{"users":[],"teams":[],"apps":[]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true

# Remove protection (unlock branch)
gh api repos/kellylford/Scores/branches/0.5release/protection \
  --method DELETE
```

#### **Check Protection Status:**
```bash
# View current protection rules
gh api repos/kellylford/Scores/branches/0.5release/protection

# List all protected branches
gh api repos/kellylford/Scores/branches --jq '.[] | select(.protected==true) | .name'
```

### Method 3: GitHub REST API

#### **Create Protection Rule:**
```bash
curl -X PUT \
  -H "Authorization: token YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github.v3+json" \
  https://api.github.com/repos/kellylford/Scores/branches/0.5release/protection \
  -d '{
    "required_status_checks": null,
    "enforce_admins": true,
    "required_pull_request_reviews": null,
    "restrictions": {
      "users": [],
      "teams": [],
      "apps": []
    }
  }'
```

## üéØ Specific Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Lock Completed Release Branches

**Goal:** Prevent any changes to `0.5release` and `0.51release` branches.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Pattern-based rule (covers both branches)
Branch pattern: *release
Protection: Restrict pushes + Include administrators
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Both current and future release branches protected
- ‚úÖ Branches preserved as historical snapshots
- ‚úÖ Tags remain intact and accessible
- ‚úÖ Can't accidentally modify completed releases

### Scenario 2: Protect Main Branch (Solo Developer)

**Goal:** Enforce discipline for a solo developer using PR workflow.

**Recommended Settings:**
```bash
Branch: main
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date  
‚ùå Require review (solo developer)
‚úÖ Include administrators (applies to you)
```

**Workflow:**
1. Create feature branch for changes
2. Make commits on feature branch
3. Create PR to merge to main
4. Merge PR (automatic since no review required)

### Scenario 3: Team Development

**Goal:** Full protection for collaborative development.

**Recommended Settings:**
```bash
Branch: main
‚úÖ Require a pull request before merging
‚úÖ Require review from code owners
‚úÖ Require status checks to pass
‚úÖ Require branches to be up to date
‚úÖ Dismiss stale reviews
‚úÖ Include administrators
```

## üóÇÔ∏è Alternative: Branch Deletion

### When to Delete vs Protect

**Delete If:**
- ‚úÖ You have tags marking the exact release state
- ‚úÖ You want to keep repository clean
- ‚úÖ You don't need branch-based references

**Protect If:**
- ‚úÖ You want visible branch history
- ‚úÖ You might need to reference branch commits
- ‚úÖ You want to prevent accidental recreation

### Deletion Commands

```bash
# Delete local tracking branches
git branch -d -r origin/0.5release origin/0.51release

# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete 0.5release
git push origin --delete 0.51release

# Verify deletion
git branch -a
```

**Note:** This only deletes branches, not tags. Your release tags (`v0.5.0-preview`, `v0.51.0-preview`) remain intact.

## üìã Best Practices

### Release Branch Management

1. **Use Consistent Naming**
   ```bash
   # Good patterns
   release/v1.0.0
   1.0.0-release  
   v1.0-release
   
   # Our current pattern
   0.5release
   0.51release
   ```

2. **Protection Timing**
   - Protect immediately after release creation
   - Use pattern-based rules for automatic protection
   - Document protection rules in repository README

3. **Tag Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Create tags before protecting branches
   git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
   git push origin v1.0.0
   
   # Then protect the branch
   ```

### Repository Rules

1. **Pattern-Based Protection**
   ```bash
   # Covers all release branches
   *release
   release/*
   v*.*.*
   hotfix/*
   ```

2. **Graduated Protection Levels**
   ```bash
   # Main branch: Full protection
   main: Require PR + Reviews + CI
   
   # Release branches: Lock completely  
   *release: Restrict all pushes
   
   # Feature branches: No protection
   feature/*: (no rules)
   ```

## üö® Important Considerations

### Access Control
- **Include Administrators**: Even repo owners follow rules
- **Emergency Access**: GitHub provides override mechanisms for emergencies
- **Team Permissions**: Rules interact with repository permissions

### CI/CD Integration
- **Status Checks**: Require builds/tests to pass
- **Required Contexts**: Specify which CI systems must succeed
- **Branch Updates**: Automatic updates vs manual merging

### Recovery Options
- **Rule Modification**: Protection rules can be updated anytime
- **Emergency Override**: GitHub admins can bypass in emergencies
- **Branch Recreation**: Deleted branches can be recreated from commits

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Can't push to protected branch"**
```bash
# Solution: Use pull request workflow
git checkout -b feature/my-changes
git push origin feature/my-changes
# Create PR on GitHub
```

**"Status checks required but not configured"**
```bash
# Solution: Either configure CI or disable status checks
# In branch protection: Uncheck "Require status checks"
```

**"Branch protection applies to administrators"**
```bash
# Solution: Either follow rules or temporarily disable
# Edit protection rule: Uncheck "Include administrators"
```

### Emergency Access

If you need to bypass protection temporarily:
1. **Disable Protection**: Remove or modify the rule
2. **Make Changes**: Push necessary fixes  
3. **Re-enable Protection**: Restore the original rule

## üìù For Scores Repository

### Current State
- **Release Branches**: `0.5release`, `0.51release` 
- **Release Tags**: `v0.5.0-preview`, `v0.51.0-preview`
- **Main Branch**: `main` (active development)

### Recommended Action
Create branch protection rule:
- **Pattern**: `*release`
- **Protection**: Restrict pushes + Include administrators
- **Result**: Both current and future release branches automatically protected

This preserves release history while preventing accidental modifications to completed releases.
