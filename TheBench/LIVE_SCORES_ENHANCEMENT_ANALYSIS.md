- **Down & Distance:** "3rd & 5 at IND 46"
- **Possessing Team:** Team abbreviation and full name
- **Field Position:** Yard line, yards to endzone
- **Last Play:** "(Shotgun) M.Willis pass incomplete deep left to M.Heath"
- **Drive Statistics:** Plays, yards, time elapsed

### Enhancement Options

#### Option 1: Compact Enhancement (Recommended)
```
Green Bay Packers 0 - Indianapolis Colts 0
14:10 - 1st | GB Drive: 7 plays, 18 yards, 3:36 | 3rd & 5
```

#### Option 2: Two-Line Format
```
Green Bay Packers 0 - Indianapolis Colts 0 (14:10 - 1st)
GB possessing: 3rd & 5 at IND 46 | Drive: 7 plays, 18 yards
```

#### Option 3: Full Context
```
Green Bay Packers 0 - Indianapolis Colts 0

## Technical Implementation Strategy

### API Usage Optimization
```python
def get_enhanced_live_scores():
    # 1. Get basic live scores (fast)
    basic_games = get_live_scores_all_sports()
    
    # 2. Enhance high-priority sports only
    enhanced_games = []
    for game in basic_games:
        league = game.get('league')
        
        if league in ['NFL', 'NCAAF']:
            # Get detailed football data
            enhanced = enhance_football_display(game)
        elif league in ['NBA', 'WNBA', 'NCAAM']:
            # Get basketball context (if implemented)
            enhanced = enhance_basketball_display(game)
        elif league == 'NHL':
            # Get hockey special situations (if implemented)
            enhanced = enhance_hockey_display(game)
        else:
            # Use basic display (MLB already enhanced)
            enhanced = game
            
        enhanced_games.append(enhanced)
    
    return enhanced_games
```

### Performance Considerations
- **Selective Enhancement:** Only call detailed APIs for high-value sports
- **Caching Strategy:** Brief cache (30-60 seconds) for detailed data
- **Graceful Fallback:** Always fall back to basic display if enhancement fails
- **User Control:** Allow users to disable enhancements if desired

### Error Handling
```python
def enhance_football_display(game):
    try:
        # Attempt enhanced display
        details = get_game_details(game['league'], game['id'])
        return format_enhanced_football(game, details)
    except:
        # Fall back to basic display
        return format_basic_display(game)
```

2. **Performance Impact:** Measure response time with enhancements
3. **Fallback Testing:** Ensure graceful degradation when enhancements fail

### User Testing
1. **Accessibility Testing:** Verify screen reader compatibility
2. **Information Density:** Confirm enhanced displays aren't overwhelming
3. **Sport-Specific Feedback:** Get input from fans of each sport
