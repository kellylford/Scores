## üîß Implementation Details

### ESPN API Data Mapping
```python
def get_base_runner_description(situation):
    """Convert ESPN situation data to English description"""
    
    on_first = situation.get('onFirst', False)
    on_second = situation.get('onSecond', False)
    on_third = situation.get('onThird', False)
    
    # Count runners
    runner_count = sum([on_first, on_second, on_third])
    
    if runner_count == 0:
        return "Bases empty"
    elif runner_count == 3:
        return "Bases loaded"
    elif runner_count == 1:
        if on_first:
            return "Runner on 1st"
        elif on_second:
            return "Runner on 2nd"
        elif on_third:
            return "Runner on 3rd"
    elif runner_count == 2:
        if on_first and on_second:
            return "Runners on 1st and 2nd"
        elif on_first and on_third:
            return "Runners on 1st and 3rd"
        elif on_second and on_third:
            return "Runners on 2nd and 3rd"
    
    return "Unknown base situation"
```

### Count Description
```python
def get_count_description(situation):
    """Format count information"""
    balls = situation.get('balls', 0)
    strikes = situation.get('strikes', 0)
    outs = situation.get('outs', 0)
    
    return f"{balls}-{strikes} count, {outs} out{'s' if outs != 1 else ''}"
```

### Complete Baseball Format Function
```python
def format_baseball_enhanced_display(game_data):
    """Generate enhanced baseball display with base runners"""
    
    # Extract basic game info
    game_name = game_data.get('name', 'Unknown Game')
    status = game_data.get('status', 'Unknown')
    
    # Get situation data from competitions
    situation = None
    for comp in game_data.get('competitions', []):
        if 'situation' in comp:
            situation = comp['situation']
            break
    
    if not situation:
        return f"{game_name} ({status})"
    
    # Build enhanced display
    base_description = get_base_runner_description(situation)
    count_description = get_count_description(situation)
    
    # Current batter
    batter = situation.get('batter', {}).get('athlete', {})
    batter_name = batter.get('displayName', 'Unknown') if batter else 'Unknown'
    
    # Last play
    last_play = situation.get('lastPlay', {})
    last_play_text = last_play.get('text', 'No recent play') if last_play else 'No recent play'
    
    # Format lines
    line1 = f"{game_name} ({status})"
    line2 = f"{base_description} | {count_description} | At bat: {batter_name}"
    line3 = f"Last: {last_play_text}"
    
    return f"{line1}\n{line2}\n{line3}"
```
