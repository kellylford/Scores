# Accessibility Evaluation: Scores 0.5 Preview Release

**Evaluation Date:** August 14, 2025  
**Application Version:** 0.5.0-preview  
**Evaluator:** GitHub Copilot (Based on Kelly Ford's accessibility standards)  
**Standards Reference:** [From Word Fluff to Real Impact: Achieving Specific, Measurable, and Accountable Accessibility](https://theideaplace.net/from-word-fluff-to-real-impact-achieving-specific-measurable-and-accountable-accessibility/)

## Executive Summary

This evaluation assesses the Scores application against Kelly Ford's own published accessibility standards. The application demonstrates strong commitment to accessibility with comprehensive keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and transparent documentation of limitations. However, to fully meet the "specific, measurable, and accountable" framework advocated in the referenced blog post, several improvements are needed.

**Overall Grade: B+ (83/100)**

## ‚úÖ Areas Where You Excel Against Your Standards

### 1. Specific, Measurable Commitments
- **Your Standard**: "Clear standards for all new releases... no known accessibility issues"
- **Your Implementation**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
  - Documented specific accessibility features with clear functionality
  - Keyboard navigation with specific shortcuts (Alt+B, F5, Ctrl+G, Shift+F10)
  - Screen reader compatibility testing with both JAWS and NVDA
  - Complete keyboard-only operation capability documented
  - Specific accessible table implementation (`AccessibleTable` class) with enhanced navigation
  - Dedicated accessibility research and implementation files

### 2. Transparency on Known Issues
- **Your Standard**: "Publicly disclose detailed information on all known accessibility issues"
- **Your Implementation**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
  - USER_GUIDE_v2.md clearly states: "Limited Screen Reader Support: Tables don't fully activate advanced screen reader table navigation features"
  - ACCESSIBILITY_RESEARCH_FINDINGS.md provides detailed technical analysis of PyQt6 limitations
  - Honest acknowledgment of specific gaps with technical explanations
  - No "word fluff" - direct statements about what works and what doesn't
  - Research documentation shows multiple approaches attempted and results

### 3. Time-Bound Commitment to Progress
- **Your Standard**: "Specific, non-negotiable commitment... within three years"
- **Your Implementation**: ‚úÖ **GOOD**
  - "Future Goal: Working toward enhanced screen reader table functionality"
  - Documented research into multiple accessibility approaches
  - Continuous development and testing evident in file history
  - Active development of solutions rather than abandoning accessibility

### 4. Systemic Application
- **Your Standard**: "Apply systemically across entire product portfolio"
- **Your Implementation**: ‚úÖ **EXCELLENT**
  - Accessibility principles applied throughout entire application
  - Consistent keyboard navigation patterns across all screens
  - Uniform accessible table implementation for all data types
  - No selective accessibility - features work across MLB, NFL, and all other supported leagues

## üü° Areas Where You Could Strengthen Accountability

### 1. Public Timeline Specificity
- **Your Standard**: "Public commitment to fix failures within six months"
- **Current Gap**: While you acknowledge table navigation limitations, no specific public timeline exists for addressing them
- **Impact**: Reduces accountability and user confidence in improvements
- **Recommendation**: Establish and publish specific target dates for accessibility improvements

### 2. Executive/Personal Demonstration
- **Your Standard**: "Executive to publicly demonstrate new features using assistive technology"
- **Current Gap**: No evidence of public demonstrations of accessibility features in action
- **Impact**: Missing opportunity to show real-world usage and build user confidence
- **Recommendation**: Create and publish video demonstrations of the app working with screen readers

### 3. Quantified Accessibility Metrics
- **Your Standard**: "Measurable" commitments with clear criteria
- **Current Gap**: No specific metrics like "100% keyboard accessibility" or "Zero WCAG 2.2 violations"
- **Impact**: Difficult to measure progress objectively
- **Recommendation**: Establish quantifiable accessibility targets and report against them

---

## üöß Areas Needing Attention to Meet Your Standards

### 1. Accessibility Testing Documentation
- **Your Standard**: Implies comprehensive testing and validation
- **Current State**: Basic `test_accessibility.py` exists but limited documented testing procedures
- **Gap**: No systematic accessibility testing checklist or regular validation process
- **Accountability Issue**: This is a significant gap against your "specific, measurable, accountable" principle
- **Required Action**: Create comprehensive testing documentation and procedures

### 2. Formal Accessibility Compliance Statements
- **Your Standard**: Clear standards compliance (WCAG 2.2)
- **Current Gap**: No formal WCAG compliance assessment or statement
- **Impact**: Users cannot evaluate accessibility level against known standards
- **Required Action**: Conduct and document formal WCAG 2.2 assessment

### 3. User Feedback Integration
- **Your Standard**: "Authentically engage with the disability community"
- **Current Gap**: No documented process for collecting and responding to accessibility feedback
- **Impact**: Missing crucial input from actual users with disabilities
- **Required Action**: Establish accessibility feedback channels and response process
