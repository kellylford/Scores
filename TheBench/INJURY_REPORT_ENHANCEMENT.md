# Injury Report Enhancement Summary

## Problems Fixed

### 1. **Data Structure Issue**
- **Problem**: The original implementation expected a flat list of injuries, but ESPN API returns team-based nested structure
- **Solution**: Created specialized `InjuryTable.populate_injury_data()` method that properly flattens the nested team structure

### 2. **Accessibility Issues**
- **Problem**: Used basic QTableWidget without screen reader support
- **Solution**: Implemented `InjuryTable` class extending `AccessibleTable` with:
  - Proper keyboard navigation (arrow keys, tab handling)
  - Screen reader descriptions for each cell
  - Context-aware accessibility labels
  - Consistent focus management

### 3. **Missing Data Fields**
- **Problem**: Only showed basic injury info
- **Solution**: Enhanced to show comprehensive injury data:
  - Player name and position
  - Team information
  - Injury status (Day-to-Day, 15-Day-IL, etc.)
  - Injury type and details
  - Expected return date

## Implementation Details

### New InjuryTable Class
```python
class InjuryTable(AccessibleTable):
    """Specialized table for displaying injury report data"""
    
    def populate_injury_data(self, injury_data: List[Dict], set_focus: bool = True):
        """Flattens ESPN API team-based injury structure"""
        
    def enhance_cell_accessibility(self, row: int, col: int, value: Any):
        """Adds context-aware accessibility descriptions"""
```

### Data Structure Handling
- **Input**: `[{"team": {...}, "injuries": [...]}, ...]`
- **Output**: Flat table with all injuries across teams
- **Fields**: Player, Position, Team, Status, Type, Details, Return Date

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow keys for cell navigation, Tab to exit
- **Screen Reader Support**: Each cell has descriptive labels
- **Focus Management**: Automatically focuses first cell when opened
- **Consistent Behavior**: Matches boxscore and standings table patterns

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Injury reports now open successfully** - Fixed the core functionality
2. **Screen reader accessible** - Full navigation and context for visually impaired users
3. **Comprehensive data display** - Shows all available injury information
4. **Consistent interface** - Matches the design patterns of other data tables
5. **Proper keyboard navigation** - Intuitive controls for all users

## Testing Verified

✅ **Injury dialog opens correctly**
✅ **Data displays in organized table format**  
✅ **Keyboard navigation works properly**
✅ **Screen reader accessibility implemented**
✅ **Handles empty/missing data gracefully**
✅ **Integrates with existing application flow**

The injury report feature is now fully functional and accessible, providing the same high-quality experience as the standings, boxscore, and plays features.
