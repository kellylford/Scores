## üéØ Live Scores Implementation Opportunities

### Current Implementation
Our live scores currently show:
```
Chiefs vs Ravens (4th 2:15)
3rd & 8 at KC 42 | TD 7pts Chiefs: 8 plays, 75 yards, 4:23
Last: Mahomes pass complete to Kelce for 12 yards
```

### Baseball Enhancement Possibilities
We could add rich baseball information:
```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
Count: 1-2, 2 outs | Runners on 1st, 2nd
At bat: E. De La Cruz | Pitching: T. Megill
Last: Pitch 4 - Strike 2 Foul
```

### Data Availability by Sport
- ‚úÖ **Baseball (MLB)**: Full situation data including count, runners, players
- ‚úÖ **Football (NFL/NCAAF)**: Down, distance, field position, drives
- ‚úÖ **Basketball (NBA/NCAAB)**: Game clock, period information
- ‚úÖ **Hockey (NHL)**: Period, game clock information
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Soccer**: Basic status only (no detailed situation data)

## üîß Technical Implementation Notes

### API Endpoints
- **Scoreboard**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/{league}/scoreboard`
- **Game Detail**: `https://site.api.espn.com/apis/site/v2/sports/{sport}/{league}/scoreboard/{gameId}`

### Data Refresh Strategy
- **Live Games**: Update every 10-30 seconds for current situation
- **Completed Games**: No situation data available
- **Pre-Game**: Limited status information

### Memory Considerations
- Situation data adds ~2-5KB per live game
- Rich player information includes headshot URLs
- Historical data not available in situation object

## üéØ Enhancement Recommendations

1. **Baseball Focus**: Implement rich baseball situation display
2. **Sport-Specific**: Tailor information display per sport type
3. **User Preference**: Allow users to choose detail level
4. **Performance**: Cache player information to reduce API calls
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure all new information is screen reader accessible

ESPN provides incredibly detailed game status information that could significantly enhance the live scores experience, especially for baseball games where situation context (runners, count, current players) is highly valuable to fans.

## üéØ IMPLEMENTATION PROPOSALS - Baseball Base Runner Enhancement

### Proposal A: Compact Base Status Integration
**Add base runner info to existing football-style format**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th) | Runners: 1st, 2nd
Count: 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
Last: Pitch 4 - Strike 2 Foul
```

**Pros:**
- Minimal space usage
- Consistent with current format
- Clear runner identification

**Cons:**
- Gets long with multiple runners
- Less visual than other options

### Proposal B: Baseball Diamond Icons
**Use visual base indicators**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
‚óá ‚óÜ ‚óÜ | 1-2 count, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
3rd 2nd 1st
Last: Pitch 4 - Strike 2 Foul
```

**Legend:**
- ‚óá = Empty base
- ‚óÜ = Runner on base

**Pros:**
- Highly visual and intuitive
- Quick recognition of base situation
- Compact representation

**Cons:**
- May not display well in all fonts
- Accessibility considerations for screen readers

### Proposal C: Color-Coded Base Status
**Use background colors for occupied bases**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
Bases: [3rd] [2nd] [1st] | 1-2, 2 outs
At bat: E. De La Cruz | Last: Strike 2 Foul
```

**Color scheme:**
- Green background = Runner on base
- Gray background = Empty base

**Pros:**
- Clear visual distinction
- Accessible with proper contrast
- Easy to implement

**Cons:**
- Requires color support
- May be too colorful for some users

### Proposal D: Abbreviated Base Notation
**Use standard baseball notation**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th) | R12_ 
Count: 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
Last: Pitch 4 - Strike 2 Foul
```

**Notation:**
- R12_ = Runners on 1st and 2nd, empty 3rd
- R_2_ = Runner on 2nd only
- R123 = Bases loaded
- R___ = Bases empty

**Pros:**
- Very compact
- Standard baseball notation
- Space efficient

**Cons:**
- Requires learning the notation
- Less intuitive for casual fans

### Proposal E: English Base Description
**Use clear English descriptions**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
Runners on 1st and 2nd | 1-2 count, 2 outs
At bat: E. De La Cruz | Last: Strike 2 Foul
```

**Special cases:**
- "Bases loaded" (all three bases)
- "Scoring position" (2nd and/or 3rd)
- "Bases empty"

**Pros:**
- Immediately understandable
- Accessible to all users
- Natural language

**Cons:**
- Takes more space
- Can be verbose with multiple runners

### Proposal F: Hybrid Visual + Text
**Combine icons with text for clarity**

```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
‚óÜ1st ‚óÜ2nd ‚óá3rd | 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
Last: Pitch 4 - Strike 2 Foul
```

**Format:**
- ‚óÜ1st = Runner on first
- ‚óá2nd = Second base empty
- Uses both visual and text cues

**Pros:**
- Best of both visual and text approaches
- Clear and accessible
- Flexible format

**Cons:**
- Longer than pure icon approach
- More complex to implement

### Proposal G: Smart Context Display
**Show different information based on game situation**

**High-leverage situations:**
```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th) - SCORING POSITION!
Runner on 2nd | 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
```

**Bases loaded:**
```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th) - BASES LOADED!
3 runners | 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
```

**Normal situations:**
```
Brewers @ Reds (Bot 10th)
Runner on 1st | 1-2, 2 outs | At bat: E. De La Cruz
```

**Pros:**
- Highlights important situations
- Dynamic based on context
- Engaging for fans

**Cons:**
- More complex logic required
- Inconsistent format
