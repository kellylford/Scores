🧀 PACKERS: Fixed documentation examples for Wisconsin fan

Replaced Chicago Bears examples with Green Bay Packers:
- Updated all drive examples to use Packers players (Love, Watson, Jones, Doubs)
- Changed team abbreviations from CHI to GB  
- Used appropriate Packers player names instead of Bears

Much more appropriate for a lifelong Wisconsinite and Packer fan's documentation!
No Bears fans were harmed in the making of this commit. 🏈
