# Audio Pitch Map Implementation - Summary

## ðŸŽ¯ **What We've Implemented**

Successfully implemented **Phase 1 MVP** of the Audio Pitch Map feature as outlined in `AUDIO_PITCH_MAP_DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## ðŸ”Š **How It Works**

### **Audio Mapping System**
- **Frequency Mapping**: Pitch height (Y-axis) â†’ Beep frequency
  - Higher pitches = Higher frequency beeps
  - Lower pitches = Lower frequency beeps
- **Duration Mapping**: Pitch velocity â†’ Beep duration  
  - Faster pitches = Shorter beeps
  - Slower pitches = Longer beeps
- **Location Description**: Spoken feedback about pitch location

### **Coordinate Interpretation** 
Uses our validated coordinate system:
- **For Right-handed batters**: Lower X = inside, Higher X = outside
- **For Left-handed batters**: Lower X = outside, Higher X = inside  
- **Vertical**: Lower Y = higher in zone, Higher Y = lower in zone

## ðŸŽ® **How to Use**

### **In the Game Details View:**
1. Navigate to **MLB** â†’ Select a **game** â†’ Go to **Plays** section
2. Use **arrow keys** to navigate to individual pitches
3. **Right-click** or press **Shift+F10** on any pitch to open context menu
4. Choose from audio options:
   - **ðŸ”Š Play Pitch Audio**: Hear the current pitch location
   - **ðŸŽµ Play Pitch Sequence**: Hear all pitches in the at-bat from first to last

### **Context Menu Options:**
- **Play Pitch Audio (P)**: Single pitch audio with location feedback
- **Play Pitch Sequence (S)**: Sequential playback of entire at-bat with 1.2s timing
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Shift+F10 when pitch is selected
- **Mouse access**: Right-click on any pitch item

### **Audio Feedback:**
- You'll hear a **beep** with frequency representing pitch height
- **Lower frequency** = lower pitch location
- **Higher frequency** = higher pitch location  
- **Shorter beep** = faster pitch
- **Longer beep** = slower pitch

## ðŸ›  **Technical Implementation**

### **Files Created/Modified:**
- **`simple_audio_mapper.py`**: Core audio mapping system
- **`scores.py`**: Integrated audio into GameDetailsView
- **`test_audio_integration.py`**: Test script for validation

### **Key Features:**
- **Windows-compatible**: Uses `winsound` for reliable audio
- **Context menu access**: Right-click or Shift+F10 for audio options
- **Single pitch playback**: Immediate audio feedback for selected pitch
- **Pitch sequence playback**: Complete at-bat audio with timing
- **Accessible**: Provides spoken location descriptions  
- **Lightweight**: Simple beep system, no complex audio libraries

## ðŸ“‹ **Example Usage**

### **Real Game Example - Lindor Hit-by-Pitch:**
- **Coordinates**: (28, 199)
- **Audio**: Low frequency beep (represents low pitch)
- **Duration**: Medium (94mph fastball)
- **Description**: "Low and way inside" (correct for HBP)

### **Navigation Flow:**
```
MLB â†’ Brewers vs Mets â†’ Plays â†’ Top 1st â†’ Lindor at-bat â†’ Right-click on Pitch 5
â†’ Context Menu â†’ "ðŸ”Š Play Pitch Audio" â†’ BEEP! (Low frequency = low inside pitch)

Or:
â†’ Context Menu â†’ "ðŸŽµ Play Pitch Sequence" â†’ 5 BEEPS in sequence (entire at-bat)
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Success Validation**

âœ… **Context Menu System**: Right-click and Shift+F10 support  
âœ… **Single Pitch Audio**: Immediate feedback for selected pitch  
âœ… **Pitch Sequence Playback**: Complete at-bat audio with timing  
âœ… **Coordinate Integration**: Uses validated ESPN coordinate system  
âœ… **Batter Handedness**: Correctly interprets inside/outside based on batter  
âœ… **Accessible Navigation**: Multiple ways to access audio features  

## ðŸŒŸ **Next Steps for Enhancement**

Ready for **Phase 2** development:
- **Stereo Panning**: Left/right audio for inside/outside pitches
- **Pitch Type Sounds**: Different tones for fastball, slider, etc.
- **Sequence Playback**: Play entire at-bat as audio sequence
- **Advanced Audio Libraries**: Move to 3D spatial audio

## ðŸ”§ **Troubleshooting**

### **If No Audio:**
- Ensure you're on Windows (uses `winsound`)
- Check system volume is enabled
- Verify speakers/headphones are working
- Try the test script: `python test_audio_integration.py`

### **Testing Audio:**
```bash
python simple_audio_mapper.py      # Test basic audio system
python test_audio_integration.py   # Test with real pitch data
```

**Status**: âœ… **Phase 1 MVP Complete and Working**  
**Ready for**: Enhanced Phase 2 features and user feedback
