# SportsScores Enhancement Summary

## Date: August 9, 2025

### Implemented Enhancements

#### 1. **Fixed News Headlines Display** üì∞
- **Issue**: Kitchen sink news articles needed to be displayed as clean headline lists (consistent with other parts of the app)
- **Solution**: 
  - Modified `_add_news_list_to_layout()` to display only headlines instead of full formatted text
  - Updated `NewsDialog` to show clean headline lists
  - Made news items consistently activatable with Enter key and double-click
- **Files Changed**: `scores.py` (lines ~1467-1505, ~1983-1993)

#### 2. **Added "Go to Date" Functionality** üìÖ
- **Feature**: New date navigation feature for all scoreboards
- **Implementation**:
  - Created `DatePickerDialog` class with month/day/year controls
  - Added intelligent day range validation (handles February, leap years, etc.)
  - Implemented `go_to_date()` method in `LeagueView`
  - Added **Ctrl+G** keyboard shortcut
  - Added "Go to Date" button to navigation bar
- **Usage**: 
  - Press **Ctrl+G** or click "Go to Date" button
  - Select month, day, and year using dropdown and spin controls
  - Click "Go to Date" to navigate to selected date
- **Files Changed**: `scores.py` (new `DatePickerDialog` class, updated `LeagueView`)

#### 3. **Consistent Escape Key Navigation** ‚å®Ô∏è
- **Issue**: Escape key behavior was inconsistent across the application
- **Solution**: 
  - Updated `BaseView` to handle Escape as "go back" for all views
  - Added Escape handling to all dialog classes:
    - `DatePickerDialog` - closes dialog
    - `StandingsDetailDialog` - closes dialog
    - `KitchenSinkDialog` - closes dialog
    - `NewsDialog` - closes dialog
    - `StandingsDialog` - closes dialog
  - Updated main application to handle Escape globally
  - Special handling for `HomeView` (Escape disabled since there's nowhere to go back)
- **Behavior**: 
  - **Escape** now consistently goes back to previous level in navigation
  - Works the same as Alt+B (Back button)
  - Provides intuitive navigation throughout the application

### Technical Details
