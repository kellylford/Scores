"""Tests for the MLB wild card standings (espn_api.get_mlb_wildcard_standings).

ESPN's responses are faked rather than fetched. These cover the parts where a
wrong answer misrepresents the playoff picture: which teams are shown as already
in, the order of the race, and the fact that ESPN's published `playoffSeed` is
preserved rather than re-derived from win percentage.

The source is ESPN's standings endpoint with `type=1`, which returns the 12
non-division-leaders per league. The three teams present in the default
standings but absent from that list are the division leaders.
