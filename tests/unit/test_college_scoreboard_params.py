"""Tests for college scoreboard `groups=`/`limit=` params (espn_api).

ESPN silently drops most of a college slate when `groups=` is missing, and the
failure is invisible — a 200 response with a short list. These pin down which
leagues get the parameter, which must not, and the limit ceilings, since all of
that was established by measurement rather than documentation.
