# Do This To Release - Sports Scores v0.8.0

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Repository Access Must Be Resolved Before Release ‚ö†Ô∏è**

## üö® **REQUIRED DECISION - RESOLVE BEFORE RELEASE:**

### **Repository Access Configuration**

**Current Status:** Repository is PRIVATE (needs cleaning)

**Problem:** Users won't be able to access documentation links in releases

**Required Action:** Choose ONE approach before proceeding:

#### **Option A: GitHub Pages (Recommended - Easiest)**
- Enable GitHub Pages on this private repository
- Documentation becomes public at `kellylford.github.io/Scores`
- Source code stays private, docs become accessible
- **Action:** Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages ‚Üí Enable Pages from main branch

#### **Option B: Separate Documentation Repository**
- Create new public repository: `Scores-Documentation`
- Move documentation files there with GitHub Pages
- Update all documentation links in release notes
- **Action:** Create public docs repo, migrate files, update links

#### **Option C: Public Releases with Embedded Documentation**
- Keep repository private
- Include full documentation text in release notes (very long)
- Remove all GitHub documentation links from release notes
- **Action:** Rewrite release notes with embedded docs

#### **Option D: Make Repository Public**
- Make entire repository public for release
- Clean up repository first
- **Action:** Repository cleanup, then make public

**‚ö†Ô∏è DECISION REQUIRED:** Pick one option above and implement it before continuing with release steps.
