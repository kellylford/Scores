# macOS Accessibility Implementation Status

## Current Date: August 18, 2025

## Progress Summary

### ✅ COMPLETED
1. **MacVersion Branch Setup**: Successfully created and switched to MacVersion branch
2. **Build System**: PyInstaller working - creates 77MB macOS app bundles
3. **VoiceOver Solution Discovery**: Identified that QPushButton widgets are fully accessible to VoiceOver while QListWidget/QTableWidget are not
4. **Proof of Concept**: Created working accessibility demos that prove button-based UI works with VoiceOver
5. **HomeView Conversion**: Successfully converted HomeView from QListWidget to QPushButton architecture
6. **LeagueView Basic Conversion**: Fixed most QListWidget reference errors in LeagueView
7. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Updated from Windows Alt shortcuts to macOS Option shortcuts
8. **Platform Detection**: Added macOS-specific modifier key handling

### ⚠️ PARTIALLY WORKING
1. **LeagueView**: App launches and can select sports without crashing, but has issues:
   - Python crashes occurring during navigation
   - News functionality appears broken (showing blank)
   - Game data may not be displaying properly

### ❌ SPECIFIC ISSUES ENCOUNTERED (August 18, 2025 Session)
1. **Python Crashes**: App crashes during navigation between views
2. **News Feature Blank**: News dialog opens but shows no content
3. **App Stability**: Multiple crash scenarios need investigation
4. **UI Conversion Incomplete**: LiveScoresView and other views still need button conversion

### ❌ REMAINING ISSUES
1. **App Stability**: Python crashes happening during use
2. **News Feature**: News dialog showing blank content
3. **Live Scores View**: Still using QListWidget - needs conversion to buttons
4. **Game Details**: May need accessibility improvements
5. **Error Handling**: Some error scenarios may still reference old QListWidget code
6. **VoiceOver Testing**: Need comprehensive testing of converted UI with actual VoiceOver

## Technical Implementation Details

### Architecture Change
- **FROM**: QListWidget-based UI (inaccessible to VoiceOver)
- **TO**: QPushButton-based UI (fully accessible to VoiceOver)

### Key Files Modified
- `scores.py`: Main application logic - HomeView and LeagueView converted
- `models/game.py`: Added accessibility methods for VoiceOver-friendly text
- `main_simple.py`: macOS entry point with basic accessibility

### Proven Working Solutions
- `accessible_sports_demo.py`: Demonstrates perfect VoiceOver integration with buttons
- Button-based UI provides full keyboard navigation and screen reader support
- macOS modifier keys (Option instead of Alt) properly detected

## Next Steps (For Future Session)

### PRIORITY 1: Stability
1. Debug and fix Python crashes
2. Investigate news functionality issues
3. Add better error handling throughout

### PRIORITY 2: Complete UI Conversion
1. Convert LiveScoresView from QListWidget to QPushButton
2. Ensure all remaining views use accessible UI patterns
3. Remove any remaining QListWidget references

### PRIORITY 3: VoiceOver Testing
1. Test complete user flow with VoiceOver enabled
2. Verify all game information is properly announced
3. Test keyboard navigation throughout app

### PRIORITY 4: Polish
1. Rebuild final macOS app bundle
2. Test on clean macOS system
3. Document accessibility features for users

## Build Information
- **Python**: 3.13.5
- **PyQt6**: 6.9.1
- **PyInstaller**: 6.15.0
- **Target**: macOS Sequoia with VoiceOver
- **App Size**: ~77MB

## Repository Status
- **Branch**: MacVersion (2 commits ahead of origin)
- **Last Commit**: Fixed LeagueView QListWidget references
- **Working Tree**: Clean

## Key Learning
QPushButton widgets provide complete VoiceOver accessibility while maintaining all functionality. This architectural change is the correct solution for macOS accessibility compliance.
