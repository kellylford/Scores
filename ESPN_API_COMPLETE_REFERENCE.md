- `period.displayValue` - Inning ("1st Inning")
- `period.type` - Top/Bottom of inning
- `scoringPlay` - Highlights scoring plays
- `awayScore` / `homeScore` - Current game score

## üöÄ Enhancement Opportunities by Category

### NFL - Phase 1 Enhancements ‚úÖ COMPLETED
- [x] Yardage display (`statYardage`)
- [x] Play type labels (`type.text`)
- [x] Situational context (`yardsToEndzone`)
- [x] Visual highlighting

### NFL - Phase 2 Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Player involvement (extract from `text` field)
- [ ] Formation information (if available in future API updates)
- [ ] Penalty details (enhanced parsing of penalty plays)
- [ ] Time between plays (`wallclock` timestamps)
- [ ] Drive efficiency metrics

### MLB - Potential Enhancements
- [ ] Count display: "Ball 1 [2-1]" format using `pitchCount`
- [ ] Outs context: "(2 outs)" using `outs` field
- [ ] Batting order: "Leadoff batter" using `batOrder`
- [ ] Player handedness: "vs LHP" using `bats` and pitcher data
- [ ] Pitch location: Strike zone visualization using `pitchCoordinate`

## üìä Display Format Comparison

### NFL - Before and After Enhancement
```
BEFORE:
[1st & 10 from CHI 25] T.Bagent pass complete to receiver

AFTER:
[1st & 10 from CHI 25] PASS: (+8 yards) T.Bagent pass complete to receiver
[RED ZONE 3rd & 2 from CHI 18] RUSH: (+1 yard) Running back up the middle
[GOAL LINE 4th & 1 from CHI 3] TOUCHDOWN: Pass complete for touchdown (7-14)
```

### MLB - Current Enhanced Format
```
CURRENT (Already Enhanced):
Pitch 1 : Ball 1 (95 mph Fastball)
Pitch 2 : Strike 1 (88 mph Slider)
Ball 2 (92 mph Changeup)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Notes

### Data Retrieval Pattern
```python
# This is the proven pattern that works well
nfl_scores = ApiService.get_scores('NFL', datetime.now())
game_id = nfl_scores[0].get('id')
details = ApiService.get_game_details('NFL', game_id)
drives_data = details.get('drives', {})

# For individual plays within drives
for drive in drives_data.get('previous', []):
    for play in drive.get('plays', []):
        yardage = play.get('statYardage', 0)
        yards_to_endzone = play.get('start', {}).get('yardsToEndzone', 0)
        # Process enhanced data...
```

### Performance Considerations
- ESPN API responses are large (27K+ lines for detailed games)
- Only extract needed fields to minimize processing
- Cache frequently accessed data
- Use background loading for non-critical enhancements

### Accessibility Requirements
- All enhancements must work with screen readers
- Use descriptive text instead of symbols/emojis
- Maintain keyboard navigation
- Provide context without visual cues

This reference provides the foundation for any future enhancements while documenting our current successful implementation patterns.
