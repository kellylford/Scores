# Sports Scores GUI - Project Status Report
**Date: July 28, 2025**
**Branch: sports**

## Project Overview
A PyQt6-based desktop application for browsing live sports scores using the ESPN API. Designed to be superior to web-based alternatives with enhanced accessibility and rich functionality.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED FEATURES

### 1. Core Navigation & UI
- **Home Screen**: League selection with keyboard navigation
- **League Screens**: Game lists with start times
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus on lists after navigation (fixed with QTimer delays)
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Alt+B (Back), Escape (Back), Alt+P (Previous Day), Alt+N (Next Day)
- **Clean UI**: Professional layout with clear information hierarchy

### 2. News Integration
- **Enhanced News Dialog**: Full ESPN article integration
- **Browser Integration**: Double-click headlines to open full stories
- **Author Bylines**: Shows article authors when available
- **News Discovery**: "--- News (X stories) ---" entries with story counts
- **Complete Articles**: Direct links to ESPN's full articles with images and formatting

### 3. Game Details (Partially Working)
- **Basic Information**: Team names, records, home/away status
- **Venue Details**: Stadium name, city, state
- **Weather Information**: Conditions and temperature
- **Start Times**: Proper scheduling information display
- **Smart Data Formatting**: Complex data structures formatted for readability

### 4. API Integration
- **ESPN API**: Live data from site.api.espn.com
- **Multiple Leagues**: NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, WNBA, NCAAF, NCAAM, Soccer
- **Date-Based Queries**: Support for historical and future game data
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures

## ‚ö†Ô∏è KNOWN ISSUES

### 1. Date Navigation Problems
- **Button Functionality**: Previous/Next day buttons don't always respond to hotkeys
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Issues navigating to buttons and pressing Enter/Space
- **Score Display**: Previous days showing "final" instead of actual scores
- **Inconsistent Behavior**: Date navigation works sporadically

### 2. Game Details Broken
- **Data Display**: Still showing "dict with X items" instead of formatted data
- **List Objects**: Some fields show "list with two items" but no actual content
- **Format Function**: The `format_complex_data` function not properly integrated
- **Configuration**: Additional details section showing technical descriptions instead of user-friendly data

### 3. Crash Issues (Fixed)
- **NoneType Error**: Fixed crash when `extract_meaningful_game_info` returned None
- **Null Checks**: Added proper validation for empty/invalid data

### Key Functions
- **SportsScoresApp**: Main PyQt6 application class
- **get_scores()**: ESPN API integration with date support
- **extract_meaningful_game_info()**: Data extraction from complex ESPN responses
- **format_complex_data()**: Smart formatting for different data types (partially working)
- **Date Navigation**: previous_day(), next_day() methods

## üìã NEXT STEPS (When Resuming)

### Priority 1: Fix Date Navigation
- Debug button keyboard navigation issues
- Fix Alt+P and Alt+N hotkey responsiveness
- Ensure score display shows actual scores on previous days
- Test button focus and Enter/Space activation

### Priority 2: Fix Game Details
- Debug why `format_complex_data` isn't being applied correctly
- Fix display of complex data structures (news, leaders, standings, etc.)
- Ensure "Additional Details" section shows formatted content
- Test all configurable fields for proper display

### Priority 3: Enhancements
- Add score display (actual game scores, not just start times)
- Improve error handling for missing data
- Add more leagues if needed
- Performance optimizations

## üéØ PROJECT VISION
This GUI application aims to provide a superior sports information experience compared to web alternatives:
- **Faster Navigation**: Keyboard-first design
- **Rich Information**: Complete game details and news
- **Offline-First**: Desktop application with better reliability
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader friendly with proper focus management
- **Integration**: Seamless browser integration for full articles

## üíæ CURRENT STATE
- **Basic functionality working**: League navigation, news, start times
- **Major issues**: Date navigation and game details formatting
- **Code status**: All committed to sports branch
- **Ready for**: Debugging session to resolve remaining issues

The foundation is solid - the app successfully provides live sports data with good navigation and news integration. The remaining issues are primarily UI/UX refinements rather than core functionality problems.
