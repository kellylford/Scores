## ðŸ“± **iPhone Compatibility Answer**

### Can Python Apps Run on iPhone?
**Short Answer:** No, not directly.

### Why Not?
- **iOS Restrictions:** Apple doesn't allow interpreted languages to run natively
- **App Store Policies:** Apps must be compiled to native iOS code
- **Security Model:** iOS prevents dynamic code execution

### Alternatives for iPhone
1. **Pythonista App** ($9.99): Python scripting environment for iOS
2. **Web App Version**: Convert to web app using HTML/JavaScript
3. **Progressive Web App (PWA)**: Web app that can be "installed" on iPhone
4. **Cross-Platform Rewrite**: Use React Native or Flutter

### Recommended iPhone Strategy
For your Sports Scores app, the best iPhone approach would be:
1. **Create a web version** using your ESPN API knowledge
2. **Make it a PWA** so users can install it like a native app
3. **Leverage existing functionality** but with web technologies

## ðŸš€ **Next Steps**

### Potential Mobile Expansion
